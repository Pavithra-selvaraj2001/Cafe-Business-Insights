This analysis presents a detailed overview of key metrics in the cafe business, including profitability, discount trends, delivery performance, and order behavior. 
It highlights top products, high-demand regions, and supports data-driven decisions to improve efficiency and profit.

Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive dashboard that analyzes various aspects of a cafe business using transactional and shipment data. The dashboard focuses on key business indicators such as Profit, Discounts, Discontinued Products, Freight Costs, and Delivery Performance across multiple countries, product categories, and shipping companies.

# Objectives
1. Identify high- and low-performing product categories based on profit.

2. Understand the impact of discounts on overall revenue and margin.

3. Monitor delivery performance by shipper and optimize logistics.

4. Highlight discontinued products to improve product lifecycle decisions.

5. Track freight expenses and find opportunities for cost optimization.

6. Detect trends in frequent orders and region-wise customer demand.

# Tools & Technologies
> Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data preprocessing and initial visual analysis.

> Power BI – Final dashboard creation with interactive visuals.

> Jupyter Notebook – Data cleaning, transformation, and exploration.

# Key Insights
> Beverages, Meat & Poultry, and Grains are the most profitable categories.

> Most countries apply a uniform 25% discount, with few applying 20% or 15%.

> United Package consistently delivers early and performs best among shippers.

> Freight expenses are equally distributed across all shippers, indicating a flat-rate model.

> High-frequency products include Aniseed Syrup, Boston Crab Meat, and Camembert Pierrot.

> Discontinued products are concentrated in Meat & Poultry, Condiments, and Grains.

# Recommendations
> Focus promotions on high-profit items and frequent-order regions (e.g., Germany, USA).

> Re-evaluate and optimize discount rates to protect margins.

> Strengthen relationships with high-performing shippers (especially United Package).

> Replace or rethink stocking of low-performing or discontinued products.

> Audit freight structure for potential savings or efficiency gains.
